## 🚬 Memes and Conclusion

In addition to the issues caused by the competition host, Codabench, some memes emerged as well. The frustration we experienced is shown here: 

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="meme/loading.gif" alt="meme" style="height: 300px; margin-left: 100px;">
  <img src="meme/pablo.png" alt="pablo" style="height: 300px;">
</div>

You can find out more memes in the `meme` folder.

However, our motto is **Never give up**, and that’s exactly what we did. We embraced every tear we shed, right until the very last one. That’s how empires are built 🏆
